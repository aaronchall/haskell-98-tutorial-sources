# haskell-98-tutorial-sources
A Gentle Introduction to Haskell, Version 98 - and climbing?

This is supposedly the source for the official Haskell tutorial.

I have been taking notes from it, but I'm worried parts may be obsolete,
and I want to track the changes and perhaps accepts updates. Perhaps
this version can be used to update the tutorial at 
https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/

If there is a more official repo, please let me know.

Both Paul Hudak and John Peterson are deceased.

Perhaps I should attempt to contact Joseph Fasel or Reuben Thomas.

From the index.html:
